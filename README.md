## How Mira Works

1. Users interact with Mira through the `chat_ui.html` interface.
2. User queries are received by the Flask backend.
3. The backend constructs a prompt using the context from `data.txt`.
4. This prompt is sent to the Gemini API for processing.
5. Mira returns a contextually accurate response, displayed in the chat interface.
