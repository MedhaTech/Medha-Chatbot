Mira is the ideal solution for organizations seeking a reliable, on-brand FAQ assistant for their digital platforms.

## Key Features

- **Modern Web Interface:** Seamless user experience via an intuitive web UI (`chat_ui.html`).
- **Powered by Gemini 2.0 Flash:** Leverages Google's advanced Generative Language API for fast, intelligent responses.

## How Mira Works

1. Users interact with Mira through the `chat_ui.html` interface.
2. User queries are received by the Flask backend.
3. The backend constructs a prompt using the context from `data.txt`.
4. This prompt is sent to the Gemini API for processing.
5. Mira returns a contextually accurate response, displayed in the chat interface.
